# Binary Search Tree

## Binary search tree designed in Javascript with level-order, in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversal created in accordance with the Odin Project

This project is a practice project that was built in accordance with the ODIN Project Binary Search Tree assignment to practice working with binary search trees, tree traversal, and balancing trees. A comprehensive list of skills and concepts practiced in this project:

- Build a binary search tree from an array of values
- Balancing a tree and rebalancing a tree that becomes unbalanced
- Breadth first traversal: Level-order traversal
- Depth first traversal: pre, in, and post order tree traversal
- Inserting and deleting values into a tree
- Factory functions
- Recursion

## Notes on Driver Script:

This assignment required doing the following steps after completing the project to confirm that the code worked as expected:

1. Create a binary search tree from an array of random numbers < 100. You can create a function that returns an array of random numbers every time you call it if you wish.
2. Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling isBalanced.
3. Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order.
4. Unbalance the tree by adding several numbers > 100.
5. Confirm that the tree is unbalanced by calling isBalanced.
6. Balance the tree by calling rebalance.
7. Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling isBalanced.
8. Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order.
